# Barbarian Assault Personal Bests
This Plugin serves to replicate the function of the normal barbarian assault plugin function as well as adding the ability 
to use the following commands.
!pb Barbarian Assault
!pb Ba healer
!pb Ba collector
!pb Ba defender
!pb Ba attacker

Capitilization is Important!!!!

The time saved into each one is based on the time shown after w10 is completed and the ability to be saved into a role specific pb can be
turned on and off though the default is on.


If you find any issues with the plugin please submit an issue in this repository and I will try to look at it an fix it as soon as I can.
